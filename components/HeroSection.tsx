          Hi, my name is Dylan, and I am looking to advance myself further with
          both experience and into the industry. I have a deep passion to create
          and learn with modern technologies such as a few examples, TypeScript,
          React, NodeJS, GraphQL and other tooling that provides great DX while
          providing amazing UX as well.
